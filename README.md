# Funding-3.0
Dveloped an decenterlized appilication using blockchain technology where users can fund ethers using their MetaMask wallet and also withdraw them.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The front end of the application is designed using html,css and javascript.
Here i used Ganache as a remote blockchain for deploying the application using Truffle.
Imported all the Ganache accounts into MetaMask for performing all the operation in the application
You can go to projectfunding folder using integrated terminal in VS code then write npm start to run the application.
You should have Ganache downloaded and integrated with MetaMask to use the application then only you can use it(i guess).
